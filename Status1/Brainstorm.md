In this class I want to build a top-down, rogue-like with a pixel art style that takes place in a medieval/fantasy world. The main premise will be that the player must venture down into a cave to capture insects that contain rare and valuable dye. These insects can be captured using throwable nets. However, the player will only have a limited number of nets, so they must decide whether they want to capture a common insect or save the net for the chance to capture a rarer one. As the player explores the cave, they will encounter various environmental hazards, monsters, and potentially other cavers that they will have to either fight or avoid. Additionally, the player’s light source will only have a limited amount of fuel, meaning that they must return to the entrance of the cave before being engulfed in darkness. The duration of the light source’s light can be upgraded by the player using money which will allow the player to venture deeper into the cave where rarer and more valuable insects exist. One possible end game objective could be to make as much money as possible before losing all your lives (the player loses a life when dying or running out of light in the cave). A final important mechanic in the game would be the dynamic economy where prices of certain insects increase/decrease based on the player’s actions such as selling a large number of one type of insect.
