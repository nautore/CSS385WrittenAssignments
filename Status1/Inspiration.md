For my top-down dungeon crawler roguelike, I am drawing inspiration from several games for their mechanics and aesthetics. In the game Pizza Tower, the player must return to the beginning of the level before a timer runs out which induces a sense of urgency. I want to implement a similar mechanic into my game where the player must return to the beginning of the level before their light source runs out of fuel. In terms of art style and level design, I want to draw inspiration from Enter the Gungeon. I like its simple, yet clear art style. Additionally, I like how each level has various hazards the player must avoid along with objects that they can interact with such as tables to create cover. Finally, I want to incorporate elements of Streets of Rogue into my game, specifically its immersive sim mechanics. The game provides multiple ways to complete each objective based on the player’s playstyle, and the environment will dynamically react to the player’s actions. In my game, I want the player’s decisions and actions within a level to influence both the in-game economy and change the structure of future levels in the same run.
