###Design Principle 1 “Easy to learn, hard to master”:
This principle means that the core mechanics of the game are simple, yet becoming good at the game takes time and effort. Some games that utilize this principle are Counter Strike 2, Rocket League, and Trackmania. 
One pro of this principle is the game can be enjoyed by both a casual and hardcore audience. Another pro is that having a high skill ceiling encourages players to improve their abilities either to become better than themselves or other players. One con of this principle is that not all games necessarily need to be easy to learn. For example, a game like Dark Souls is both difficult to learn and difficult to master, which is part of what makes it so popular. Another con is that making a game difficult to master can frustrate casual players who want to experience the full game but are unable to because they lack the required mastery.
In my game, I will incorporate this principle by creating simple core mechanics (moving, shooting, interacting with objects) that the player can quickly understand. I will then slowly introduce more complex mechanics to the player such as the upgrade system. In order to get a very high score in my game, the player will have to become proficient at these core mechanics and have substantial knowledge of the various locations in the game. All of this will ensure that the player is not overwhelmed early on but is encouraged to improve their skill.
###Design Principle 2 “Center the game around a single core mechanic”:
This principle means that a game’s main gameplay loop should revolve around a single mechanic that has been extensively refined to be fun and engaging. Some games that utilize this principle are Doom, Forza, and Portal. 
One pro of this principle is that it simplifies the game and allows the player to focus on mastering that core mechanic. Another pro is that a well-defined core mechanic can make balancing easier as everything can be balanced around that mechanic. One con of this principle is that it may lead to reduced gameplay variety. Another con is that revolving the game around a popular core mechanic may make the game feel less unique.
Since my game will likely be a top-down shooter, I will incorporate this principle by focusing on refining the core mechanic of shooting and eliminating enemies. This can be accomplished through sound/visual effects, proper weapon/enemy balancing, and good level design. Ensuring that this core mechanic is polished and fun to interact with will build a solid foundation for other game mechanics.
###Design Principle 3 “Provide regular feedback and rewards”:
This principle means that a game should give the player feedback based on their actions or provide rewards for making progress. Some games that embody this principle include World of Warcraft, Animal Crossing, and The Sims.
One pro of this principle is that players will feel rewarded for their efforts or know whether they are doing something right or wrong. Another pro is that it incentivizes players to complete certain objectives in order to receive a reward. One con of this principle is that too much feedback or rewards in a short time frame can overwhelm the player or desensitize them to the rewards. Another con is that some games may want to give limited rewards to the player to enhance overall difficulty or to slow down progression.
In my game, I want to incorporate regular rewards in the form of upgrading the player’s equipment and unlocking new areas to explore. I also want to make sure that the game’s various systems provide helpful feedback to the player. For example, the combat system will include visual and audio cues for when the player has dealt or taken damage. Incorporating this principle will allow the player to better understand how to properly interact with the game’s systems while staying engaged.
