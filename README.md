# Project Proposal

# Elevator Pitch
Caverns of Dye is a 2D medieval fantasy dungeon crawler where you explore a vast cave system to capture insects that contain valuable dyes. During your expedition, defeat enemy monsters and trap prized bugs while being careful that your torch doesn’t go out. Sell the rare insects you’ve obtained to a mysterious merchant outside the cave to earn precious gold that can be used to upgrade your equipment, unlock new cave entrances, and most importantly pay off your rising debt to the merchant. Survive as long as possible before succumbing to the deadly caverns or your insurmountable debt.

# Game Synopsis, Objectives, Mechanics
Caverns of Dye will be a high-score based game where the player must survive as many days as possible without getting lost in the caves or missing a constantly increasing debt payment. They will explore a room-based environment where both enemies and capturable insects will spawn. Some enemies will charge towards the player, and some will keep their distance and shoot at the player with various projectiles. The player can eliminate enemies by shooting them with arrows. Upon entering a room, all exits will be locked until all enemies are eliminated. Insects can be captured by throwing nets but will attempt to evade the player and potentially escape the room if not captured fast enough. The player must also be careful not to accidentally kill the insects while eliminating the enemies as this will make the insects uncapturable.
While exploring the cave, the player’s torch will slowly start to go out, giving them limited time to capture insects. Remaining in the cave after the torch goes out will cause the player to lose a life. The player can either return to the entrance of the cave they entered or take a chance of finding another exit deeper in the cave.
Upon exiting the cave, the player can sell the insects they’ve captured to a merchant for gold. After each expedition, the player must pay a fee to the merchant that increases after each trip to the cave. Earned gold can also be used to buy upgrades such as increased torch light duration, stronger arrows, and more nets.
