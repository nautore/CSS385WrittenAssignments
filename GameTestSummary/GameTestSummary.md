## Combined Responses from 3 Testers
1.
- bounds of caves wouldn't always register when entering, having to move around or under the trapezoid to enter
- had negative 20 gold at one point
- ultrawide monitor skewed most things to the left

Not too many technical issues showed up, it was pretty self-explanatory on how to actually "progress" through the game and shoot arrows at enemies/shoot nets. There were some UI overlapping issues near the top-middle of the screen, but that's about it  

Wouldn't quite consider it a technical issue, but the buttons and UI offset is slightly messed up on ultrawide (or non 16:9?) resolutions. Still playable, but the game is basically happening on the top left of my screen, would be nice to either have it centered or use the whole screen. Other than that, no technical issues and everything was super smooth!

2. 
- sound design was satisfying
- game ran smoothly 
- original artwork
- responsive controls  

I like how the combat/movement feels, it's pretty smooth and rapid if you're close to enemies. The concept of repeatedly going back to the cave to get more insects/resources is really cool, and it can definitely be expanded upon. The animations/sprites are pretty nice as well  

- The combat was fun in that you have to constantly be moving and dodging enemies with the dash (which is a cool mechanic). At the same time, you have to pay attention to where your arrows are going and account for travel time to make sure they hit the enemies.

- The animations, visuals, and textures were all very nice and, though simple, made it fun to look at.

3. 
- reading allat before playing, i just wanted to play so id go back and forth between the tutorial and the game when i needed to figure something out  

I'm assuming this is still bare bones progress-wise, but the background grey screen can definitely use some background or art to make it more appealing to look at. In terms of coins, there doesn't seem to be anything to actually buy, which would put other players off in terms of replayability. There doesn't seem to be any challenge or obstacles to retrieve insects or even to kill enemies, it might be better to introduce more claustrophobic environments or more difficult enemies to make it more challenging. With buying stuff from the merchant, it'd be better to have a prompt to say which button to press to "buy/sell items", since not everyone will remember it from the "How to Play" section  

The insects felt pretty hard to capture due to a combination of a few things:

1. Nets felt too small
2. Insect movement was either too fast or too unpredictable
3. Limited number of nets.

It seems like increasing the net size would solve this problem, as the movement issue would be trivial and the number of nets makes sense in the context of the game's objective.

4. 
- was confused on how saving/loading works

I wasn't confused about too much stuff, but not being able to buy items made me a bit confused initially since I didn't get if I was doing something wrong. Besides that, everything else pretty much makes sense  

The timer was a little bit confusing at first. It seems like you should get more time for defeating an enemy, entering a new room, or by using gold to increase your timer.
I liked the idea of it, but it just felt limiting and felt like an artificial barrier that you couldn't do anything about. Also, it feels slightly unrewarding, as you lose the sense of progression or exploration due to limited time to be in the cave (basically you cant go deeper than 2 or 3 caves it seems).

5. 
- either having a clickable floating popup of how to play within the game itself with more visuals and less text OR maybe having floating suspended fly and googly dude with floating tutorial bits like "right-click to capture", "press F to pay respects" etc.
Most of the answers can be referred back to "What aspect(s) of the game did you enjoy the least", but there should be more art direction with the background of the overworld and dungeon. Enemies and insect-collecting should be more challenging either via environments or enemy difficulty. It'd be cool to also have more items to purchase or even upgrades
1. Add a warning menu when pressing escape ("Are you sure you want to return?"). I accidently pressed it and lost all my progress :)
2. Add ways to increase the timer or ways to explore further (maybe timer slows down considerably in rooms that you have already cleared?)
3. The gold balancing seems like it needs some tuning. After paying 20 gold to leave the cave, it felt like i only ever had 2 or 3 insects, maybe 4. This means that you either break even, can only purchase a heal, or need to do it a few times to buy any additional nets at all.

Overall great work though, I enjoyed playing it a lot! :D


## My Summary and Common Patterns
Overall, all the testers enjoyed the overall concept and gameplay loop of the game. The movement and combat were definitely the strongest parts of the game with testers explaining that they enjoyed keeping track of all the different things going on during combat. All the testers also enjoyed the art and animations. Several testers noted the lack of ultrawide support. Many also mentioned that having an in-game tutorial would be more beneficial than a written game guide. Most testers would like to see more rewards for progression, economy rebalancing, timer rebalancing, and reworked UI.

## GPT-5 Mini Summary of Findings and Common Patterns
### Summary of findings

- **Technical issues (common):**
  - UI and button offset on ultrawide/non-16:9 monitors (gameplay appears top-left).
  - Occasional collision/entry detection for cave bounds not registering.
  - Minor UI overlap near top-middle.
  - One report of negative gold; otherwise boots/launch fine.

- **Most enjoyed (common):**
  - Smooth, responsive controls and combat (dash, movement, shooting).
  - Good animations/artwork and satisfying sound design.
  - Fun core loop combining dungeon-crawler + bullet-hell.

- **Least enjoyed / pain points (common):**
  - Tutorial/How-to-play is text-heavy and interrupts play; players prefer in-game, visual prompts.
  - Capture mechanics feel frustrating: nets too small, insect movement too fast/unpredictable, occasional net/projectile non-registration.
  - Sparse background/art in some screens; limited visible progression or things to buy reduces replayability.
  - Timer feels limiting and unrewarding; unclear feedback for buying/saving/loading.

- **Confusing elements (common):**
  - Saving/loading has poor feedback (no clear confirmation).
  - Buying from merchant unclear or impossible to tell if working.
  - Timer mechanics and how to extend/earn time.
  - How to exit/find correct caves (navigation/visual cues).

- **Requested changes (common):**
  - Add contextual, visual in-game tutorials/popups (clickable, minimal text).
  - Increase net size or tweak insect movement and projectile speed/registration.
  - Provide clearer save/load/buy confirmations and escape/quit warning.
  - Improve art/backgrounds, balance gold/rewards and timer mechanics, add more purchasable items/upgrades.

### Common patterns / priorities
1. UX polish first: fix ultrawide/UI offsets, overlapping UI, and provide clear visual feedback for save/load/buy actions and escape warnings.
2. Improve capture feel: increase net hitbox, adjust insect and projectile speeds, and ensure reliable hit registration.
3. Clarify progression and incentives: better rewards, more purchasable items/upgrades, and changes to timer to reduce frustration.
4. Reduce tutorial friction: replace long text with concise, in-game visual hints and/or contextual prompts.
5. Art and presentation: enhance backgrounds and center/scale game view for non-16:9 screens to improve immersion.
